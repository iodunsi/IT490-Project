# NewsNexus: IT 490 Systems Integration Capstone Project

This repository contains my contributions to a collaborative capstone project completed at NJIT as part of the IT 490: Systems Integration course. The project was designed to simulate a real-world production environment and integrate core Information Technology disciplines into a single full-stack system.

## Project Overview
The goal of the project was to design, deploy, and maintain a distributed web application using virtualized infrastructure and integrated backend services. The system required configuring multiple components to communicate reliably while ensuring security, scalability, and maintainability. We decided to make a Newsite called News Nexus that filtered news by category and had a social media aspect to it seeing as users can like, share, and rate the relevancy of articles that they read.

## Key Areas of Implementation
This project involved hands-on work across several core IT domains, including:

- Networking configuration and inter-VM communication
- Firewall rule setup and secure access control
- System administration within Linux-based virtual machines
- Database design and management
- Web server configuration and deployment
- Message queue implementation using RabbitMQ for service communication
- User authentication and session handling
- Third-party API integration for dynamic data retrieval

## Systems & Tools Used
- VirtualBox / Ubuntu Linux
- RabbitMQ messaging queues
- MySQL / relational database concepts
- Apache / web server configuration
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Agile / Scrum-based milestone workflow

## Testing & Troubleshooting
Throughout the project lifecycle, we performed iterative testing and debugging to:
- Diagnose client-server communication issues
- Validate authentication and database interactions
- Ensure reliable message queue processing
- Document errors and implement structured fixes
- Maintain stable deployment across virtual machine environments
